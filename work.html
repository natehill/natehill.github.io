        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>I'm the Executive Director of an organization called the <a href="https://metro.org">Metropolitan New York Library Council</a>, aka 'METRO.'</p>

        <p>METRO is a network of libraries, archives, and museums in New York City and Westchester County and a non-profit service provider for knowledge organizations all over the world. We work to advance excellence in the library, archive and museum professions, and we do this through research, software development, logistics, programs and events, exhibits, and other innovative approaches. METRO is an exceptional team that includes some of the most talented thought leaders, practitioners, and organizers in our field.</p>
        
        <p>I've always tried to bring my creative instincts into my professional life. This website is focused more on creative output than professional accomplishment. Sometimes, these overlap. Rather than put my CV or a resume in the "work" section, I thought I would include a few pictures from past projects that I genuinely enjoyed working on. Prior to my role at METRO, I worked at the Chattanooga Public Library (TN), the San Jose Public Library (CA), and the Brooklyn Public Library (NY). I've been fortunate to both lead and partner with others to develop innovative concepts and service models in all of these communities. </p>

            <p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 599 was METRO's studio space situated on Manhattan's west side in Hell's Kitchen.</p>
            <p>The facility featured audio and video digitization equipment, a digital forensics workstation, a recording booth, exhibit space, classrooms, meeting rooms, and a community kitchen.</p>
            <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic reached New York City, we realized that this amazing facility was the last thing we needed, and so we escaped our lease and our team began to work from home.</p>
            <p>We are now a remote agency, with an even larger team who are distibuted all over the world.</p>

            <p>In Tennessee, I led the development of the 4th Floor, a community makerspace and civic laboratory on the top floor of the downtown library.</p>
            <p>The project was internationally recognized, and included in the Cooper Hewitt Nation Design Museum exhibit "Designing a Better America."</p>

              <p>In California, I partnered with an architecture firm to develop a modular mobile library lab concept.</p>
              <p>I also worked as the San Jose Public library's web designer, and I managed their social media.</p>

              <img src="img/outpost.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
              <p>In Brooklyn, I led the development of the Library Outpost service model - a library without a local book collection. We were focused on DUMBO, the area between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. The idea was to only include books on the shelf that community requested online.
              
              </p>
              <p>The Outpost never came to be, but inspired similar work in other cities across the US.</p>
