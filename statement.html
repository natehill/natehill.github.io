        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>I'm an artist living and working in the New York City Area.</p>

        <p>My work speculates about natural systems that we sometimes think we understand and document, but can actually never completely comprehend. I like to explore this paradox and many of the ways we attempt to navigate it through a variety of processes including painting, sculpture, and other kinds of media.</p>

        <p>Every day, living creatures, minerals, artifacts, articles, music, data, and knowledge are collected, described, saved, accessed, and preserved by institutions to record our human-centered cultural record. For convenience, we assign names and categories to different bugs or varieties of oak trees, minerals or particles, weather phenomena or astronomical entities. We also assign names and categories to our own representations and musings about these things in the form of songs, films, books, photographs, or digital media. When making sculpture, painting, or other work, I explore the impossibility of making something consistently solitary, nameable, knowable, and unique across time when it will always be relational, interpretive, perspectival, and contextual. </p>
 
        <p>Because of this approach, my dialogue with the materials I work with often informs the direction a piece might go, both aesthetically and conceptually. The admission that nothing is static results in unexpected discoveries, making every artwork feel like an experiment or a type of inquiry before, during, and after it is being made. Some of this results in experiments that expire, without leaving any finished product. More frequently, I find myself carving wood into forms that merge the shapes of living entities, their homes, their means of sustenance, and their communities into convergences and expressions of their life cycles. Or sometimes, this results in messy compositions of liquid media and pulverized or shredded natural materials, sawdust, sand, all carefully selected from their sites and origins. My hope is that I can capture both seconds and millenia, the microscopic and the infinite, a sensation of instantaneous completion as well as labor, durability, and process.</p>
