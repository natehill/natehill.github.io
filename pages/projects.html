<h3>METRO | 599, New York, New York</h3>
<h4>2017</h4>


  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>The Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) is the largest of nine regional library councils in New York State, serving all the boroughs of New York City as well as Westchester County. METRO’s membership spans +/-250 libraries, archives, museums, non-profits, and others as organizational members, and also includes students, consultants, and others as individual members. The organization’s mission is to facilitate collaboration, build capacity, support innovation, and enhance resource sharing by connecting the efforts of the diverse membership.</p>
      <p>In March of 2017, the Metropolitan New York Librarty Council opened a new 8,000 square foot studio called 599 on the west side of midtown Manhattan. 599 is an architectural and programmatic instantiation of a digital library in physical space: we offer tools and resources that empower our members to read, write, and participate on the web. More specifically, our activities are focused on the digitization, description, and presentation of cultural heritage materials. 599 makes the labor and the communities associated with archiving and preservation visible, legible, and accessible; the space itself is a platform for action so that participants can organize to create their own community narratives.</p>

<h3>The 4th Floor, Chattanooga, TN</h3>
<h4>2013</h4>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>The 4th floor is a public laboratory and educational facility with a focus on information, design, technology, and the applied arts. It is a responsive community platform that features services shaped by the creative and technological needs of the citizens of Chattanooga. Formerly an abandoned library attic, the more than 12,000 square foot space now hosts equipment, expertise, programs, events, and meetings that work within this scope. While traditional library spaces support the consumption of knowledge by offering access to media, the 4th floor is unique because it supports the production, connection, and sharing of knowledge by offering access to tools and instruction.
</p>
<p>
      The 4th Floor also functions as the library’s “beta space”, a public space for prototyping new services and solutions before implementing them across the library building and system. This iterative approach to service design allowed us to rapid prototype new ideas in a risk-friendly environment.  On the 4th Floor, you’ll find library staff solving library service delivery problems right alongside community members using the tools and space to solve their own problems. Those tools include vinyl cutters, laser cutters, 3d printers, and more. The 4th Floor is an ongoing experiment. </p>

  <h3>LibraryLab</h3>
<h4>2010</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>The Library Lab is an open source, portable, modular solution for content creation in libraries. It was an entry in the Digital Public Library of America's 'beta sprint' design competition in 2010. The collaboration included myself, <a href="http://www.nollandtam.com/">Noll & Tam Architects</a>, <a href="http://www.matthewwilliamsdesign.com/">Matthew Williams Design</a>, Wikimedia DC, and others. The full pdf is available <a href="../img/LibLabReport_final.pdf">here</a></p>

  <h3>Scan Jose - mobile local history app</h3>
  <h4>2009</h4>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
<p>The Scan Jose app took primary source artifacts, mostly historic photographs, from the California Room local history department at the library and created an interface for visitors to view the content on their mobile devices in the context in which it was originally photographed. Three tours with different narrative themes guided users through San Jose’s historic downtown with live directions between stops on the tour generated by the Google Maps API.</p>

<p>In addition to building out a mobile web app using the then-new HTML5/CSS3 specs along with jQuery mobile and the Google Maps API, I also added all of the content to Layar, an augmented reality platform. This provided another type of browsing experience. By pointing a device’s camera at the landscape, Layar would show the points of interest within the image and act as a window bridging the digital and physical worlds.</p>

  <h3>The Library Outpost</h3>
  <h4>2006</h4>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
  <p>In 2006, I began a research project at Pratt Institute describing a flexible, scalable storefront library service model for connected cities using Brooklyn’s Dumbo neighborhood as a target site. This library semi-popup was programmed to have no locally hosted book collection.</p>
