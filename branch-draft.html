          <h2>Draft for Branch Magazine</h2>
          <p>Maintaining a vibrant creative practice is an essential part of my work as the leader of an organization working to address big problems like digital equity, the preservation of history, and soon / in-the-works, the climate crisis and cultural heritage. By pairing work that is measured in hours, days, and fiscal quarters with intentionally slow, process-driven crafts that use tactile, physical materials I am able to engage in a generative approach for the discovery of contextually unique solutions to complex predicaments. Taking 2 years to transform a scavenged piece of wood into a refined object representing an idea, I make room for the process to alter the idea itself. This way of working brings me closer to the subtle, intricate, and complex natural processes that we are immersed within, yet are also at odds with the widespread, short-sighted demand for profit and unceasing, interminable growth. The pictures below show the process and some of the byproducts of me making a wooden box sculpture named <b>Triploid Hemerocallis</b>.

          <p>The carved plywood panels pictured below are made lovingly with a handheld grinder, and not with a computer-aided router. I call them <b>Margulis Panels</b> because they are inspired by the work of the biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis">Lynn Margulis</a>, who discovered and popularized the concept of endosymbiosis. The process by which these panels are made explores growth, combination, and mergers of form. I lay out circles at random, overlap them, join them, and then begin to carve. In the process a new form emerges, one that is rooted in the origin shapes but has also taken on a new life of its own. Designer Joris Laarman said “Our digital age makes it possible to not just use nature as a stylistic reference, but to actually use the underlying principles to generate shapes, just like an evolutionary process.” I question what is lost when one pushes the application of all of these underlying principles into the research and computational design phase of making things rather than the iterative, slow, hands on process of fabricating something. Laarman’s <a href="https://www.jorislaarman.com/work/bone-chair/">bone chair</a> (which, to be clear, is brilliant) can be printed the same way over and over with extremely high fidelity. To me, this does not sound like an evolutionary process at all. Margulis panels are much lower fidelity and may ultimately look different based on what I had for lunch that day or whether or not the sun was shining. They are not fabricated using a master algorithm, or a set of finite procedural instructions. </p>

          <p><b>Lithops </b>is a series of stacked plywood lamps, all of which are only available in communities of 3, 5, 7 and other prime numbers as a nod to cicada populations’ genius ability to avoid overlap in their periodic emergence through statistics and probability. Like the Hemerocallis box, these lamps are meant to have a special, more private interior while the exterior presence evokes an architectural envelope, carapace, or membrane. The lit interiors connect these private spaces through visual metaphor: they are all organic routers connecting to an imaginary, living network.

          <h3>Notes</h3>
         
<p>Question is do I do more of a written piece about process (life itself as process, craft using this same process to present solutions to complex problems) or do I use specific pieces as an example of a result w/o getting too deep about the process.</p>      
<p>Is an image-heavy approach to a story with a longer load time and more data in motion against the very principles Branch is representing?</p>
<p>Do I tie this to an upcoming climate related program area at METRO, or do I keep it more about my own stuff-making, or do I weave the two together?<p>
