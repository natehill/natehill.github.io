With funding through the Knight Foundation Community Information Challenge and Benwood Foundation, the Open Chattanooga collaborative is developing an engaged community of residents and community leaders who are equipped to access, interpret and utilize open data in order to address community issues and better interact with their government.

The Chattanooga Public Library is an important partner in this collaborative. Public Libraries have always hosted collections of government documents and data, but now there is an opportunity to host and serve digital data in useful, useable formats. This will help local government make data-driven decisions, and also provides the transparent public access to government data that is essential to a true democracy.

Open Chattanooga is taking a three-pronged approach to addressing community information needs:

The City: Reform
The Mayorâ€™s Office will develop and implement strategies to shift City departments and policies toward openness, setting the standard for public information to be easily available to and understandable by citizens.

The Library: Access
The Public Library will create an open data portal, a one-stop-shop for local data to be used by citizens, including developers, designers, journalists, non-profit organizations, and researchers.

The Brigade: Engage
Using the public data opened by the City and hosted on the portal, the Open Chattanooga Brigade- a citizen-led team of creative thinkers, neighborhood advocates, data nerds, designers, developers, and entrepreneurs- will train citizens to create visualizations, apps, and other solutions to address community information needs.

Together, the Collaborative leverages local knowledge, passions, and technology to address real issues affecting Chattanoogans across neighborhoods and demographics.
