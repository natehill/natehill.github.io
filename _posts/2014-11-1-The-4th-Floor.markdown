When I arrived in Chattanooga, TN in July of 2012, the fourth floor of the downtown public library building was a mess. Measuring up at a staggering 14,000 square feet of space, in fact it qualified as a very big mess. Since the brutalist concrete building opened in 1976, nobody had properly disposed of unwanted items, instead they were moved to the attic of the building presumedly to be stored for eternity. In just one year, I organized and led an effort to clean up this space and give it back to the people of Chattanooga.

The 4th Floor now functions as the library’s “beta space”, a space where we prototype new services and solutions before implementing them across the library building and system. This iterative approach to service design allows us to rapid prototype new ideas in a risk-friendly environment. It is a public space. On the 4th Floor, you’ll find library staff solving library service delivery problems right alongside community members using the tools and space to solve their own problems. In the early days of transformation, the 4th Floor was only open during special events. Now it is open afternoons and evening daily.

The facility features state-of-the-art wireless internet access and publicly accessible 3D printers, electronics hacking, laser cutter, vinyl cutter, crafting equipment and much, much more. It also serves as a flexible event space for large scale productions. One Saturday when the library collaborated with co.lab, our local startup accelerator, to throw an event called “Makerday: Thinking in 3D” we increased the library’s door count by 1200 people.

Perhaps most importantly, the 4th Floor embraces and puts into practice David Weinberger’s “library-as-platform” concept. Our library-as-platform offers standardized public services, in this case access to tools and media, 3d printing, coding classes, and more. The community-contributed extensions or plugins on top of the library platform are represented by our strategic partnerships and the expanded functionality they bring. Animating this 14,000 square foot space with the type of rich, exciting, community-building experiences the library aspires to would simply be impossible without turning the space over to the community themselves as the animators. Library staff serve as the guides in the space, but much of the real action happens because of the projects and organizations leveraging and extending the platform the way they wish to. A women’s coding group uses the space Monday nights. The AIGA has board meetings there. The mayor’s office used the space to host police and fire pension hearings. Pechakucha used the space. The co.lab, Engage3D, the Regional Planning Agency, and many, many more all have been partners in our community platform.
