The 4th Floor of the Chattanooga Public Library was an attic full of junk. I built a team of exceptional collaborators and instigators, cleaned it out, and opened it to the public.

The result: a 14,000 square foot flexible community makerspace, hackerspace, and event, production, and presentation space.
