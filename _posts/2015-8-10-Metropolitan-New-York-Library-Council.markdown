I am currently the Executive Director of the Metroplitan New York Library Council, aka [METRO](http://blog.giglab.io/). 

METRO is the largest of nine library councils in the state of New York, serving all of New York City and Westchester County.  These councils were founded in the 1960s to facilitate the sharing of resources between different types of libraries and archives: academic, public, art, museum, corporate, and more. In the past, programmatic efforts have been primarily focused on the discovery and delivery of physical materials.  Today, METRO is increasingly oriented toward the digital, in work ranging from collaborative digitization projects that engage our diverse membership to the administration of the [Empire State Digital Network](http://empirestate.digital/), a service hub of the Digital Public Library of America.  In addition, METRO offers a wide variety of classes, lectures, events, and other professional development activities.

METRO aims to serve as a laboratory and experimental space for our growing membership, combining new developments in librarianship with emerging technologies drawn from parallel fields. The Digital Services Coordinator will help drive this innovation.
