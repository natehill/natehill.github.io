          <h2>Sculpture</h2>
          <p>There are quite a few creatures present in this picture. Each one deserves its own picture, but together they start to come to life as actors, representatives of different roles within their ecosystem, storytellers, puppets.</p>

        <p>There are many materials and processes present here. Most of the wood is locally sourced (not the plywood, of course) white oak and walnut. There is also felt, shellacked rice paper, tinted wood glue paper mache, fake eyelashes, weathered pebbles from California, and much more. All of these were made between 2019-2023. Many more have crawled, slithered, or glided away to other locations and were unavailable for this photo opportunity.</p>
        <p>I do a lot of work with the bandsaw, tablesaw, stack lamination with endless clamps, and then carving with the chainsaw, grinder, and many other tools. Many of these creatures include light sources, thus the pile of cords in the background. Light and electricity help to connect them. Even when someone moves out, I'm confident that they remain in touch with their friends.</p>
