        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p><strong>Executive Director</strong><br />
        Metropolitan New York Library Council<br />
        New York, New York<br />
        2015 - Present</p>

        <p>The Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) is the largest of nine regional library councils in New York State, serving all the boroughs of New York City as well as Westchester County. METRO’s membership spans +/-250 libraries, archives, museums, non-profits, and others as organizational members, and also includes students, consultants, and others as individual members. The organization’s mission is to facilitate collaboration, build capacity, support innovation, and enhance resource sharing by connecting the efforts of the diverse membership.</p>

        <p>In my two-year tenure as Executive Director, I have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diversified funding sources and grown revenue; am currently responsible for an annual operating budget of almost 3 million dollars</li>
          <li>Relocated and relaunched the organization: designed and built ‘599’, our new 8000 square foot studio in Midtown Manhattan</li>
          <li>Implemented new policies and bylaws, organizational structure, services and programs</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Assistant Director</strong><br />
        Chattanooga Public Library<br />
        Chattanooga, Tennessee<br />
        2012 - 2015</p>

        <p>The Chattanooga Public Library serves a population of 170,000 residents with one central library and three branch facilities. As a leader in Chattanooga, I helped this library transition out of obsolescence and obscurity to become a global source of inspiration and innovation for librarians and other knowledge workers.</p>

        <p>In my three-year tenure as Assistant Director, I:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed, developed, and led The 4th Floor. The 4th Floor, formerly an unused attic, became a heavily trafficked public laboratory and educational facility with a focus on information, design, technology, and the applied arts. This project gained international attention, and was included in the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museums critically acclaimed exhibit “By The People: Designing a Better America”</li>
          <li>Raised over 300K in philanthropic contributions, including grants from the Knight Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and Benwood Foundation.</li>
          <li>Led the implementation of a municipal open data portal hosted at the public library, with data featured as a library collection.</li>
          <li>Managed and oversaw technology projects for the library, including but not limited to recabling and network upgrades, a website redesign, and a catalog migration and upgrade.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Web Librarian</strong><br />
        San Jose Public Library<br />
        San Jose, California<br />
        2009 - 2012</p>

        <p>The San Jose Public Library is a busy urban public library system in the heart of Silicon Valley with 24 branches serving a population of more than 1 million people. I was recruited to the library’s ‘Digital Futures’ team in 2009 to help them design and launch a new web presence after the library had separated itself from a citywide content management system.</p>

        <p>In my three-year tenure as a web librarian, I:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Managed social media participation and blog content creation for the entire system</li>
          <li>Designed and implemented a website using an open source content management system</li>
          <li>Designed and launched a web-based mobile local history experience featuring historic photographs from the library’s California Collection</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Branch Library Manager, other roles</strong><br />
        Brooklyn Public Library<br />
        Brooklyn, New York<br />
        1999 - 2009</p>

        <p>The Brooklyn Public Library is the sixth largest public library system in the United States, serving more than 3 million people from 60 locations. I began my career in libraries as a Library Assistant at the Stone Avenue Branch, and over nearly a decade gained more responsibility and experience. Much of the work I do now remains grounded in lessons learned during these formative years.</p>

        <p>In nearly a decade at the Brooklyn Public Library I:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked in more than 30 diverse communities across Brooklyn</li>
          <li>Participated in IMLS/Pratt Institute/Brooklyn Public Library “Public Urban Library Service Education” degree program; work study appointments in Neighborhood Services, Web Services, Government Relations, Marketing and Communications departments</li>
          <li>Designed and developed innovative “Library Outpost” service model, a flexible service design meant for temporary and storefront facilities</li>
        </ul>
